# HARX Smart Matching System

A sophisticated matching algorithm that intelligently pairs HARX REPS with contact centre gigs posted by companies.

## Features

- **Rep Profiling & Scoring**: Evaluates reps based on experience, historical performance, availability, and language proficiency
- **Gig Requirements Analysis**: Considers industry type, expected conversion rate, and skill requirements
- **Smart Matching Criteria**: AI-powered ranking based on rep suitability score
- **Engagement & Retention Mechanisms**: Designed to maximize participation and success
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven iteration to improve efficiency

## Technical Implementation

The matching algorithm uses a weighted scoring system that considers multiple factors:

- Experience matching
- Skills alignment
- Industry expertise
- Language proficiency
- Availability compatibility
- Timezone alignment
- Historical performance
- Regional targeting

Each factor is weighted according to its importance in predicting successful outcomes. The system can be configured to adjust these weights based on specific business priorities.

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Data Models**: Structured representations of reps, gigs, and matching criteria
2. **Scoring Engine**: Calculates individual and composite scores for potential matches
3. **Optimization Algorithm**: Ensures the best overall allocation of reps to gigs
4. **User Interface**: Dashboard for visualizing and managing matches

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning integration to continuously improve matching accuracy
- Real-time availability updates and calendar integration
- Automated feedback collection and performance tracking
- Personalized rep recommendations based on learning patterns
